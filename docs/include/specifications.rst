Specifications & Requirements
=============================

According to the rules and regulations of the EU and most International Standards committees, there are some safety rules that must be taken into account for manufacturing laboratory equipment. However, although OpenDeskLab is designed according to those rules, it must be noted that the authors and creators of OpenDeskLab are **not** eligible for any kind of damage that may happen while building or using the desk. A laboratory that is used in professional environments **must** be certified by an authorized person, and OpenDeskLab is neither certified nor can fullfil all the regulations of every standard in the world.

.. warning::

    OpenDeskLab is not certified for professional use. The authors are not eligible for any damage that may occur while building or using the product.
